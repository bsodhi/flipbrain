# flipBRAIN

flipBRAIN is a web application which allows you to create what we call "Learning Trails" from different types of learning content. Most common use would be to create an online learning course by using youtube videos. flipBRAIN provides features for learner evaluation through online quizzes.

A live installation of this application is available at http://www.flipbrain.in

NOTE:
There are two versions of the applications: a) One build using Java and MySQL and b) Second which is built using Python for Google App Engine deployment. We strongly recommend using the Python version.
